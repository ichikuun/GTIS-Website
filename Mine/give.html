          Meet Paen Long. He is the seventh child in his family and loves reading 'Around the World in 80 Days' and Amelia Earhart, which inspired him to dream of the skies. His aspiration is to be a pilot, yet the nearest pilot school is all the way in Thailand.
          He also needs to finish high school with a score of at least 650.
          <br/>
          <br/> You can help fulfil the dreams of many others just like Paen Long’s. The sponsorship quantum for a primary school student is at $700, whereas a secondary high school student is at $1,000.
          <br/>
          <br/> Sponsor a child by obtaining an application form from the Church Office or email admin@gtc.org.sg.

          In recent years, we’ve had major revamps on facilities such as the basketball court and science & eco garden for the learning and benefit of students at GTIS. Our students have become individuals who are curious and passionate about plants and gardening,
          while the more active ones can be found playing sports during their lunch breaks and after school.
          <br/>

          <br/>Since 2016, the school board has decided to implement a computer lab on the school compounds. The computer lab will equip students with basic skills to prepare them for the digital world today. With that, we aim to complete the computer
          lab by 2019. Additionally we are currently short of classrooms, a proper library and a science lab. Plans for a new adjoining building have been drawn up, and the total cost of construction and facilities is estimated at S$500,000.
          <br/>
          <br/>As of January 2018, we have already raised 70% of our target goal of $500,000. No amount is too small to make a difference. Your donation will contribute to the buying of computers, equipment and additional furniture for our computer lab.
          <br/>
          <br/>Make a PayPal donation to donate@gtis.org.sg. Alternatively mail your cheque to our school or the Glad Tidings Church in Singapore today.

          To teach is to touch a life forever. At GTIS, we need a growing team of educators to impart knowledge to and inculcate values in our children. If you’re passionate and keen to contribute to the lives of the many children at GTIS, join our team of volunteer teachers today!
          <br/>
          <br/> If your school or company is looking for ways to contribute back to the society, GTIS has many platforms for engagement. Some of them include helping the school to paint wall murals, interacting with our children by conducting mini classes
          and even conducting house visits with our teachers to some of our children’s homes to better understand our student community.
          <br/>
          <br/> Should you be interested in any of the above volunteer opportunities, or have other ideas for your involvement, do not hesitate to email us at volunteer@gtis.org.sg.
